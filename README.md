===========

 This app was created by a team of four during our School of Code one week project during January 2022.

**Our project brief was to solve a problem experienced by bootcampers. After conducting some research, we identified loneliness and difficulty in connecting with other boot campers as a common issue - which we have addressed through building this app.**

**This app enables bootcampers to connect with each other - allows them to view each otherâ€™s interests, location, and also create their own profile.**

This app was built with React using a Postgres database. The deployed site can be viewed here: <br/>https://61f82496237fcb14b1cfa045--priceless-poitras-7226c6.netlify.app/
